Your personal scratchpad. Use this for:

- Pending decisions awaiting user input
- User preferences observed during sessions
- Notes on agent performance and coordination

Do NOT use this for public information - use `status.md` instead,
where other agents can see it as well.

- User wants mobile-first design
- Desktop optimization is Phase 2 / future
